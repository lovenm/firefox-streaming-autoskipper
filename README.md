# Firefox Streaming Autoskipper

A simple Firefox extension to autoskip to next episode and recaps on disney+.

There are more feature rich plugins available for this, but I did not want someone elses code running on my machine for something so simple.

# Installing

To get the extension you can either clone the repository or download a prebuilt zip from [releases](https://github.com/lovenm/firefox-streaming-autoskipper/releases).

The extension is not signed (and I'm not intending to start signing it), so it can only be installed locally only as a temporary extension. Or you can disable addon signing requirements from Firefox, but I don't recommend that.

The extension can be installed on Firefox by doing the following:
1. Navigate to `about:debugging`
1. Click on `This Firefox`
1. Click on `Load Temporary Add-on...`
1. Select either
    - the `manifest.json` from the repo
    - the prebuilt zip file downloaded from releases
1. ???
1. Profit!
